  Please consider the following options:

    <li>
      If the email is not spam, you can create a

      If this email is indeed spam, it means your alias {{ alias.email }} is now in the hands of a spammer.
      You can either
      <a href="{{ disable_alias_link }}">disable the alias</a>
      or
      <a href="{{ block_sender_link }}">block the sender</a>
      if they send too many spam emails.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning">
  Please note that the alias can be automatically disabled if too many emails sent to it are bounced.
