Hi {{user.name or ""}}

Your email cannot be sent to {{contact.email}} from your alias {{alias.email}}.

Can you please verify {{contact.email}} is a valid address?

Usually this is because the DNS record of {{contact_domain}} does not exist.

You can check its DNS record on any DNS checker websites, for example https://mxtoolbox.com/SuperTool.aspx

Please let us know if you have any question.

Best,
SimpleLogin team.
