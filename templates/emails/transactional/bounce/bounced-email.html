    Please consider the following options:
    <br />
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the email is not spam, you can create a
        <a href="https://simplelogin.io/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/">filter</a>
        to explicitly allow all emails from SimpleLogin.
        <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        If this email is indeed spam, it means your alias {{ alias.email }} is now in the hands of a spammer.
        You can either
        <a href="{{ disable_alias_link }}">disable the alias</a>
        or
        <a href="{{ block_sender_link }}">block the sender</a>
        if they send too many spam emails.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <br />
    Please note that the alias can be automatically disabled if too many emails sent to it are bounced.
