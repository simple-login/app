Your trial will end {{ user.trial_end.humanize() }}.

When the trial ends:

- All aliases/domains/directories you have created are kept and continue working.
- You cannot create new aliases if you exceed the free plan limit, i.e. have more than {{MAX_NB_EMAIL_FREE_PLAN}} aliases.
- You cannot add new domain or directory.
- You cannot create new reverse aliases.
- You cannot add new mailbox.
- If you enable PGP Encryption, forwarded emails are not encrypted anymore.

You can upgrade today to continue using all these Premium features (and much more coming).

Let me know if you need to extend your trial period.
