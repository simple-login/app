Hi

Your subscription will end on {{ next_bill_date }}.

When the subscription ends:

- All aliases/domains/directories you have created are kept and continue working.
- You cannot create new aliases if you exceed the free plan limit, i.e. have more than {{MAX_NB_EMAIL_FREE_PLAN}} aliases.
- As features like "catch-all" or "directory" allow you to create aliases on-the-fly,
    those aliases cannot be automatically created if you have more than {{MAX_NB_EMAIL_FREE_PLAN}} aliases.
- You cannot add new domain or directory.

You can upgrade today to continue using all these Premium features (and much more coming).
