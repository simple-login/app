    Hi,
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    We noticed something unusual with the setup of your mailbox <strong>{{ mailbox.email }}</strong> that could be associated with abuse.
  {% endcall %}

  {% if reason %}
    {% call text() %}
      <strong>Here's what we found:</strong> {{ reason }}
    {% endcall %}
  {% endif %}

  {% call text() %}
    To keep your account in good standing, please review your mailbox configuration.
    If we don't hear from you or see changes, we may need to disable this mailbox,
    which means you won't receive any emails forwarded to it.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    If you believe this is a mistake or have any questions, please reach out to our support team - we're happy to help clarify things.

  {% call text() %}
    Best,
    <br />
    {{ SERVICE_PROVIDER }} Team.
