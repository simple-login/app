  {% call text() %}
    {{ provider }} has informed us about an email sent to <b>{{ email }}</b> that might have been considered as spam,
    either by you or by {{ provider }} spam filter.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    Please note that explicitly marking a SimpleLogin's forwarded email as Spam affects SimpleLogin email delivery,
    has a negative effect for all users and is a violation of our terms and condition.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    If somehow {{ provider }} considers a forwarded email as Spam, it helps us if you can move the email
    out of the Spam folder. You can also set up a filter to avoid this
    from happening in the future using this guide at
    https://simplelogin.io/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting/
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    Please don't put our emails into the Spam folder. This can end up in your account being disabled on SimpleLogin.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    Don't hesitate to get in touch with us if you need more information.

    Best,
