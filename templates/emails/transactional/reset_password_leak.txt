Hello,

As part of our ongoing security monitoring, we regularly check public and dark web data sources for potential exposures that could affect our users. During one of these routine checks, we discovered that your email and password combination appeared in a recently published data dump.

For your security, we have reset your password and temporarily locked access until you set a new one. If you have a Proton account you can still access your account using "Login with Proton".

What you need to do:

* Go to Forgot my password to set a new password: {{password_reset_link}}

* Choose a strong, unique password that you haven’t used anywhere else. You can use Proton Pass to generate a stong password and store it safely.

* Once your new password is set, we highly recommend enabling Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) in your account settings for an extra layer of protection. Please go to {{account_link}} to enable it.


Please note: there’s no indication that our systems have been breached. This action is a precautionary measure to help ensure your continued security.

We understand that security alerts can be concerning, but this type of monitoring is one of the ways we keep your account safe. If you have any questions or need help resetting your password, our support team is available.
