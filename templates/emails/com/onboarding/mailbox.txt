Hi

If you have several email addresses, e.g. Gmail for work and Proton Mail for personal stuffs, you can add them into SimpleLogin and create aliases for them.

A (real) email address is called *mailbox* in SimpleLogin.

When creating an alias, you can choose which mailbox that *owns* this alias, meaning:

- emails sent to this alias are *forwarded* to the owning mailbox.

- the owning mailbox can *send* or reply emails from this alias.

You can also change the owning mailbox for an existing alias.

The mailbox doesn't have to be your personal email: you can also create aliases for your friend by adding his/her email as a mailbox.

Start create you mailbox on {{URL}}/dashboard/mailbox

As usual, let us know if you have any question by replying to this email.

Best regards,
SimpleLogin team.
