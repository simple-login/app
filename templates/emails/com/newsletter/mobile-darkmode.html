    Son from SimpleLogin here. I hope you are doing well and are staying at home in this difficult time. By the way I'm
    writing this newsletter from my couch with my cats proofreading the text :).
    <br />
    Please find below some of our latest news.
    <br />
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    1) <b>Mobile apps</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/devices.png" style="max-width: 100%">
    <br />
    <br />
    Now you can quickly create aliases on-the-go with SimpleLogin Android and iOS app,
    thanks to our mobile guy Thanh-Nhon!
    <br />
    Download the Android app on
    <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=io.simplelogin.android">Play Store</a>
    and the iOS app on
    <a href="https://apps.apple.com/app/id1494359858">App Store</a>
    .
    <br />
    With the release of the mobile apps, SimpleLogin now covers most major platforms:
    <br />
    - Desktop with SimpleLogin web app or Chrome, Firefox and Safari extension
    <br />
    - Mobile with Android and iOS app
    <br />
    The code is of course open-source and available on our
    <a href="https://github.com/simple-login/">Github</a>

    2) <b>Dark mode</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/dark-mode.gif" style="width: 100%">
    <br />
    <br />
    You have asked for it and now the dark mode is finally available, kudos to Dung - our full-stack guy.
    <br />
    You can finally enjoy using SimpleLogin in the dark.
  {% endcall %}

  {% call text() %}
    3) <b>Alias name, new UI, security page, new policy privacy</b>
    <br />
    <br />
    <img src="https://simplelogin.io/blog/new-ui.gif" style="width: 100%">
    <br />
    <br />
    You might have noticed that the web UI is now more compact: the web app has undergone a remake
    to make it more responsive for usual actions like enabling/disabling an alias, updating alias note, etc.
    <br />
    You can set a name for your alias too: this name is used when you send emails or reply from your alias.
    <br />
    We have also created a new
    <a href="https://simplelogin.io/security/">security page</a>
    that goes into the technical
    details of SimpleLogin.
    Our
    <a href="https://simplelogin.io/privacy/">privacy page</a>
    is also rewritten from scratch: nothing changes about
    your data protection
    but the page is more clear and detailed now.
  {% endcall %}

    4) <b>Facebook, Google, Github login deprecation</b>
    <br />
    We have decided to deprecate those social login options because of several reasons:
    <br />
    - Privacy: every time you sign in using one of these methods, the respective company knows and
    we have no information on what they do with this data.
    <br />
    - Not fully open-standard compatible: these platforms enjoy their monopolies and
    don't play well with open standards like OAuth2/OpenID: in fact, implementations on mobile of these social login
    require their SDK that we refuse to add because of privacy concern.
    <br />
    - Uniform experiences for all users: to have these social login in our iOS app, we need to support "Sign in with
    Apple" that isn't broadly available for Android users.
    Again, another big tech enjoying its monopoly.
    <br />
    If you happen to use one of these social login options, please create a password for your account on the
    <a href="{{ URL }}/dashboard/setting">Setting page</a>
    <br />
    You can still sign in using these social login until 2020-05-31. After this date, they will be removed.

    5) <b>WebAuthn (Beta)</b>
    <br />
    Thanks to Raymond, a user of SimpleLogin, the WebAuthn is now available in Beta.
    Please reply to this email if you want to try this out.

    On behalf of the team, I want to say thank you to all users who have helped to improve SimpleLogin code
    and even contribute important features.
