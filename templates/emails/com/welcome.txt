Hi!

{% if alias %}
  This is the first email you receive via your first alias {{ alias }}.
  This alias is automatically created for receiving SimpleLogin news and tips -
  feel free to disable it on {{URL}}/dashboard/setting#notification
  if you don't need any of  these.
{% endif %}

To better secure your account, we recommend enabling Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) or WebAuthn (Yubikey)
on your setting page at {{URL}}/dashboard/setting


If you are using Firefox or a Chromium-browser like Chrome, Edge, Brave, you can
install our Firefox add-on or Chrome extension
to create aliases in one click (literally).

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simplelogin/
Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn

{% if user.in_trial() and user.trial_end %}
When you signed up, you can use all premium features like custom domain, alias directory, mailbox, PGP
without any limit during 7 days (the "trial period").
No worries: all aliases you create during this period will continue to work normally even if you don't upgrade.
{% endif %}

At any time, you can reach out to us by simply replying to this email.

For any question or if you want to request a feature, please submit it on our forum at https://github.com/simple-login/app/discussions
