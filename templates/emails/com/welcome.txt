If you are using Firefox or a Chromium-browser like Chrome, Edge, Brave, you can
install our Firefox add-on or Chrome extension
to create aliases in one click (literally).

Firefox: https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/simplelogin/
Chrome: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/dphilobhebphkdjbpfohgikllaljmgbn

{% if user.in_trial() and user.trial_end %}
When you signed up, you can use all premium features like custom domain, alias directory, mailbox, PGP
without any limit during 7 days (the "trial period").
No worries: all aliases you create during this period will continue to work normally even if you don't upgrade.
